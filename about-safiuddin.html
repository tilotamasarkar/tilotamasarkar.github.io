# Who is Safiuddin
Safiuddin Ahmed didn't seek the success of life in money, fame, prestige, popularity or enjoyment, but in art, within the deepest realization of the mysteries of art.

For this reason, the constant effort to transcend oneself became the essence of his artistic journey. He had a powerful sense of principle, which made him a strong personality. At the basis of his rigorous personality was a continuing effort to realize purification in art. that's why i feel it's fair to call Safiuddin Ahmed, the father of contemporary printmaking in Bangladesh, the purest artist during this country.

# Early Life : 
The artist was born in an aristocratic family in Bhabanipur, Kolkata. June 23, 1922. In 1936 he was admitted to the Calcutta Government Art School. After being admitted, he could not concentrate on his work. with the help and Encouragement of Teacher Abdul Moin, the enthusiasm for painting increased in Safiuddin. Then he did not have to look back. Education ended in 1942. Then in 1944, he was admitted to the same school to study as a teacher. Ramendranath Chakraborty became his teacher. Artist Safiuddin became enthusiastic about printing with the help of teacher Ramen Chakraborty. and during this time that we can see some of his remarkable work through wood engraving, etching, drypoint.
In addition to Abdul Moin and Ramendranath, he got some great teachers. Among them were Basant Kumar Ganguly, Atulbasu, Prahlad Karmakar, along with Mukul Dey, a teacher, and principal who has been educated in the West and has been in Bengal for a long time.

As a student, he got SN Ghoshal, Haren Das, Murli Dhar Tali, Sushil Das, Sushil Chandra Sen as his classmates and friends. After the holiday, he left with his friends in Madhupur, Dumka, Giridih, JCD, Chaibasa, and Santal areas.

He was moved by the sweetness of nature, which was adorned with wide hills, mountains and trees.
The simple lifetime of the Santals, the rhythmic nature attracted him most that he may have had to maneuver to those areas again and again from his student days to 1947-48. During and after this period and in his paintings oil painting, wood engraving, etching, dry point these areas have come and gone. In 1958, he visited London to study higher education in printmaking. Wood has been engraving for therefore long, he started metal engraving there. In London, too, he received considerable support and love from the teacher of printmaking. This teacher's name is Melin Evans. He was a student of the world famous print maker Stanley Hatter. Adding etching aquatint is metal engraving. From 1948 to 1969 he was the Head of the Department of Printmaking at the Institute of Fine Arts, Dhaka University. Safiuddin Ahmed was one of the few artists who took a leading role in the movement for the establishment of institutional art in this country by joining hands with Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin and establishing the Government School of Art. After partition, he left teaching at Calcutta Government School of Arts in 1947 and moved to Dhaka. He has elevated the painting movement of this country through long seventy years of artistic pursuit and practice.
Art guru Safiuddin Ahmed was not only the founder of the Government School of Art, the birthplace of the country's art movement, but also the father of printmaking in the country. The journey of printing in this country started with his hand. Woodcut, Wood-Engraving, Metal Engraving, Dry Point, Etching-Aquatint and Lithography - all these are the means by which the artist was perfect, for which it was not difficult to carry out the departmental activities smoothly. In the beginning, Safiuddin Ahmed not only took classes in printmaking, but also in drawing and painting. The students in his class were aware, there was no chance of cheating in any way. He used to show work with devotion, explain it and collect it. He was a successful painter, printmaker and a keen sensitive teacher.

# Thouhghts
After the construction of a new settlement in Dhaka in 1947, he faced a new situation and saw the nature and public life of East Bengal with new eyes. The natural distinctiveness of the two Bengals became easily apparent to him. There was grayness in the nature there, come here and see the scattering of bluish green. It took him several years to realize this feature of the color of nature in East Bengal, to bring the desired effect by mixing blue and green. Here he became acquainted with the floods, the nets and the boats. In 1954 and 1955, the whole country, even Dhaka, was flooded for two consecutive years. Safiuddin Ahmed's house in Swamibagh was also flooded. The water level was only four inches below the floor of his house. He was not acquainted with such floods during his stay in Calcutta. This is a new experience. Arrangements to come and go by boat. There is a risk of security being disrupted at any moment. Watching the fish play in the clear water. On the flood waters he sees a rhythmic form of rain falling and hears the melodious melody of the water. He saw the form of flooded Bengal and the boundless spread of water. As a result, his subsequent paintings inevitably depicted floods, fish, nets, boats, and water diversity. In this he found the soul of Bengal. He started practicing wood engraving as a student and continued it till he went to London. While studying in a teaching course in Calcutta, he drew through Dry point. Lithography was also practiced as a mural painting at that time. At the same time he composed images through Aquatint. Even after coming to Dhaka, he drew pictures through this medium. After going to London and getting higher education through etching, he created paintings using a mixture of etching, aquatint, soft ground, lift ground, deep etching etc. After learning copper engraving in London, he abandoned wood engraving and created etching art through this new medium. His printing practice began with wood-engraving and ended with copper-engraving. Until moving to London, Safiuddin Ahmed's pictorial style was the mainstay of reality. Although he broke the shape into it, it did not completely destroy his familiar form. But after moving to London, he destroyed the figure so much that it completely lost its familiar form. In this way he assimilated the modern trends in world art in the middle of the twentieth century. As a result, many unfamiliar imagery came to the ground of his paintings. Extensive use of symbols and metaphors gives his image a completely new look. At the same time he became a novice in various experiments of technique. In the audit. He experimented with fine lines as well as with the aim of creating thick and thick lines in prints. The use of metaphors became inevitable in the changes that London education initiated in his painting. This trend continues even in the post-independence period. But in the eighties, he painted directly using eye motifs, a bunch of copper etching mediums entitled 'Kanna', 'Ekushesmarane', 'Ekattarersmriti' and later 'Ekattarersmarane' which reveal a new look or expression of the eye. The horrific memory of the horrific situation created by the destruction of the Pakistani army during the war of liberation was present in every nook and cranny of his brain. In these paintings, he seems to reflect the same situation by exposing the various expressions of the eyes.


It was not until the 1940s that he was able to attract the attention of art connoisseurs for etching and wood-engraving. He became famous for his work at that time. Through etching, aquatint, metal engraving, he created all the successful paintings through various experiments. The most successful example of this experiment is his art work entitled 'Jalerninad' (1985). To do this he uses almost all the means of printing together. He took the idea from the orchestra. Hundreds of people play musical instruments together in the orchestra, sometimes its melody becomes very loud, sometimes it goes down to the subtle pit at once, it becomes overwhelmed with sadness. This is the loud melody brought down to the pit, playing all the instruments together And the orchestra has an extraordinary ability to coordinate one of them from that he planned to create an image using all the means of printing. In this way, as a result of three years of pursuit, the film 'Jalerninad' was created, in which the means of etching, aquatint, sugar aquatint, mezotint, liftground, engraving, dph, drypoint etc. were resorted to. Safiuddin Ahmed developed a kind of weakness towards black color from his student days.

Black is considered to him as the king of color. It seems difficult for him to master this color. As a result, he went to Sealdah station in Kolkata many times in the thirties and forties to practice black color. He gained experience with the richness of this color while painting through woodengraving. Even when he went to London, he could not get away from this fascination and curiosity towards black. He uses a variety of blacks through etching-aquatint. Although the connotations of subject-glory or metaphor-symbol make Safiuddin Ahmed's art work deeply meaningful, his construction technique and creative style skills have also impressed him. He has also shown success in interdisciplinary experiments. That is, he has applied the features of one medium to the image of another medium fluently. For example, he has highlighted the features of the imprint in the diagram.

The fine-grained lines of Etching, the Bankim dynamic lines of Engraving, the poetic melody of Drypoint, as well as the elegant features of Aquatint, have enriched the texture of his lines. However, if his work is experimentally tested, it is not technically everything, it is equally rich in variety and creativity. In 1947, Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin, Shilpaguru Safiuddin Ahmed, Shilpi Anwarul Haque, Patua Kamrul Hasan, Shilpi Habibur Rahman (used to do wood-engraving / woodcutting) - all these enlightened artists started the journey of the art movement in this country.

# Finally 
Charles Doyle came to this city more than a hundred years before Safiuddin's arrival in Dhaka. The images of that time came up in his sketches, then he printed it in engraving and made a book - 'Antiquities of Dhaka'. Safiuddin did not see Dhaka through the eyes of Doyle, but went deeper and searched for the roots of the people of Bengal. Doyle came to Dhaka as a guest of the moment and a picture of instant fascination emerged in his paintings. Safiuddin came to this city with a noble vow to settle down and build an industrial movement.
Safiuddin's main aim was to promote the printing press, which was hardly practiced in Bengal. And over time, through his tireless efforts, this print medium became quite popular and became one of the mainstays of art.
